<h2>London student homes<br>to pause and relax in.</h2>

<p>
    We believe that smart, large, well-designed rooms boost learning power. And that’s what Victoria Hall King’s Cross
    is all about – giving you the best, so you can achieve your best.  A far cry from the dark corridors and dorms of
    student accommodation of old, the hallways and entrance spaces in Victoria Hall King’s Cross have all been designed
    to make the most of natural light, helping all the flats and studios feel luxurious and modern.
