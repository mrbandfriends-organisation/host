## Bleed Image Component
For this component to work correctly on Safari the parent element must be `display: flex`.

##Â ZenDesk Chat Plugin Changes
The client requested a cookie banner (handled by OneTrust) to be added to the site to 
handle activation/deactivation of cookies and tracking scripts. To enable configuration 
of the ZenDesk script, a class name had to be added to its script tag. This class name

deactivate it as required. If and when this plugin is updated, care must be taken to 
ensure that this classname remains.
